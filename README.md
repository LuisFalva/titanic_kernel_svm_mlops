# Kernel Titanic 🚢
This project is a Python package with a CLI to train and evaluate a machine learning model for the famous Kaggle's Titanic competition. The package includes functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Setup 🚀

Before running the package, make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

To set up the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh   
make setup
```

> **Note**:
> This will create a virtual environment and install all the required dependencies.

## Usage 💻
To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:

```sh   
make run
```

> **Note**:
> This will execute the run-model.sh script, which activates the virtual environment and runs the main script to train and evaluate the model.

The output will be similar to the following:

```bash

## Local dev and test 🛠️
Developers can run tests on local environment before pushing any new feature branch into remote. 
This can be useful for local development purposes, as it allows developers to test their changes in a containerized environment that closely matches the production environment.

```sh   
make test-all tag=dev
```
> **Warning**:
> Make sure to use the 'tag' argument to create a new docker image with your changes.
